# \_Prtcl

This repo contains a set of tools and libraries to help develop \_Prtcl compatible web-applications.

\_Prtcl web-applications are content management applications that work with Evees (GIT-like entities) and are built aroud reusable content rendering and manipulation modules.

> Important: these packages are under heavy development. Expect breaking changes.

Visit our [documentation](https://uprtcl.github.io/js-uprtcl) to learn how to make your content-management app \_Prtcl-compatible.

If you want to hack with \_Prtcl, one good way to start is by checking our demo app (SOON).
